      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How does the AI work?",
        "answer": "The AI is powered by Google's Gemini models. It doesn't have real-time access to private data. Instead, it leverages its vast training on a large portion of the public internet. When you ask it to analyze something, it identifies patterns and synthesizes information from this knowledge base to provide intelligent deductions, much like a world-class analyst with a near-perfect memory of the web."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Is my data private and secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. When you run AlphaWolf locally, all your inputs (like competitor URLs or ad text) remain on your computer. They are only sent to the Google AI API for processing and are not stored or used for any other purpose. Your strategic work remains confidential."

Its power comes from **deduction and synthesis**.\n\nThe model was trained on a vast portion of the public internet. When you ask it to analyze a trend or a competitor, it draws on this immense knowledge base to identify patterns, infer connections, and synthesize information that would take a human analyst months to compile.\n\nIn short: **AlphaWolf doesn't 'know' the answers, it intelligently 'deduces' them**, acting like a world-class analyst with a near-perfect memory of the public web."
