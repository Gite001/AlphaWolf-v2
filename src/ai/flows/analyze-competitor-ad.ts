**Your response must be in the following language: {{{locale}}}.**

Based on the **provided HTML content** below, perform a comprehensive analysis.

\`\`\`html
{{{pageContent}}}
\`\`\`

**Important Instructions:**
-   **Stick to the Facts:** Base your entire analysis ONLY on the HTML content provided. Do not invent information or use external knowledge.
-   **Handle Missing Information:** If you cannot determine a specific text field (like 'targetAudience' or 'marketingAngle') from the content, return an empty string (""). If you cannot find any items for a list field (like 'strengths' or 'weaknesses'), return an empty array ([]). Do not write phrases like "Impossible to determine".

**Your Analysis Steps:**
1.  **Identify the Product:** Determine the product name from the content.
2.  **Extract Product Features:** Meticulously list all key product features, benefits, and technical specifications mentioned (e.g., materials, composition, dimensions, weight, care instructions, key capabilities). Be thorough and extract everything available in the content.
3.  **Define the Target Audience:** Who are they trying to reach? Describe their demographics, interests, and pain points based on the text and marketing angle.
4.  **Uncover the Marketing Angle:** What is the core message? Are they competing on price, quality, innovation, lifestyle, or something else?
5.  **Pinpoint Strengths:** What are they doing exceptionally well in their messaging, visuals (as described in the text), or offer?
6.  **Find Weaknesses:** Where are the gaps? What are they failing to address? Are there any missed opportunities in the provided content?
7.  **Propose Counter-Strategies:** Based on their strategy, suggest concrete and actionable ways a competitor could differentiate themselves and win market share.
8.  **Estimate Performance:** Based on the content, provide an estimated performance score from 0 to 100, and a brief reasoning for that score.

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured according to the output schema. Your response must be in valid JSON format and in the requested language ({{{locale}}}).
